### General Idea

CITeam is a convenient Slack app to help MCIT students find and recruit project team members for CIT & CIS courses.

### User Profile & Pain Points

* MCIT On-Campus/Online students
 - As an MCIT student, the user often faces challenges of finding group members for course projects or simply study mates and this slack app enables them to find teammates more easily.
 - This slack app is especially useful for students who take MCIT Online as they have limited exposure to interaction with other students and thus are in stronger need of finding partners for course projects.

* Students in MCIT slack workspace
 - As the app is developed as a slack app, students need to be in the MCIT workspace to be able to use the features.

### User Story

1. A user can create a profile of themselves so that the other students can get to know more about the person that they might be working with.
2. A user can create a post of recruiting for teammates or study mates so that they can share specific details regarding the recruitment including the course, current members, the number of teammates needed, and more.
3. A user can see all their own posts that have been posted (/) so that the user has a general idea of the posted requests and be able to manage the posts later on.
4. A user can delete a post once the user no longer has the need to recruit teammates.
5. A user can edit a post if the user has the need to recruit teammates.
6. A user and the relevant users (current teammates) will be added to a channel created by the slack APP once the post is published.
7. A user can see all the available posts and choose to enter the channel that fits their need so that the user can join the channel and talk with the request posters. 

### Tech Stack
